SWI-Prolog container (inginious/env-prolog)
------------------------------------

A container image for [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/); downloads the current devel release, so may break unexpectedly.

With the current version (swipl-7.5.3; May 2017), SWI-Prolog is installed in `/usr/local/lib/swipl-7.5.3`,
and executables are in `usr/local/bin/`

I think I cleaned up after installation pretty well, but I am new at making docker containers,
so suggestions for improvement up are very welcome.
Thanks, [anthonygego](https://github.com/anthonygego), for tips on how to make a more efficient Dockerfile.
