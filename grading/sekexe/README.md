Sekexe container (inginious/env-sekexe)
------------------------------------------

Sekexe is a tool made by Jérôme Petazzoni.
https://github.com/jpetazzo/sekexe.git

This container runs scripts inside an UML. That allows to bypass some Docker's restrictions. However, it does not allow to use `run_student`.
