-- This is a model that has both a signal assignment statement as well as a
-- simple simultaneous statement.  So supposedly uses both digital and
-- analog kernel but does not have any interaction between digital and
-- analog portion.  Also there is a port declaration to check whether
-- addition of code for terminals in ports has not affected the digital
-- part.  same example as in mixed_mode_1 with ports simulate for 2e10 end
