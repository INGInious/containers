This directory contains copies of the VHDL files from The Designer's Guild
to VHDL-AMS written by Peter Ashenden, Gregory D. Peterson, and Darrell
A. Teegarden and published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc in 2002.
Morgan Kaufmann has given the University of Cincinnati permission to
release these files under the GNU Public License.

In many cases the original figures contained incomplete VHDL.  We have
added additional VHDL constructs we believed necessary to make the VHDL
complete and processable by a VHDL-AMS compliant analyzer.  As we made
changes to the examples, comments were inserted to demarcate the changes
we made.

If you find errors or corrections to these files, please submit them to
us at vests@cliftonlabs.com.  Thank you.
