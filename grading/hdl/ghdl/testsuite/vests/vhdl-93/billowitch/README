This directory contains copies of the VHDL files that were originally
developed by Bill Billowitch to form a VHDL 1076-1987 test suite.  The
development of the test suite was done with partial support of the
United States Air Force.  Both Bill Billowitch and the Air Force have
granted the University of Cincinnati permission to release these files
under the GNU Public License.

Since the original test suite was developed for the 1076-1987 standard,
some changes were required to make them compliant with the 1076-1993
standard; they are now not necessarily compilant with the earlier
(1076-1987) standard.  The VHDL files are organized into three
subdirectories, fail_tests, pass_tests or disputed_tests, corresponding
to their being non-compliant, compliant, or in question to the 1076-1993
standard (files in this subdirectory were originally located in the
compliant subdirectory of the 1076-1987 test suite).

If you find errors or corrections to these files, please submit them to
us at vests@cliftonlabs.com.  Thank you.
