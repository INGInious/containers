This directory contains copies of the VHDL files from The Designer's
Guild to VHDL written by Peter Ashenden and published by Morgan Kaufmann
Publishers, Inc in 1996.  Morgan Kaufmann has given the University of
Cincinnati permission to release these files under the GNU Public
License.

In many cases the original figures contained incomplete VHDL.  We have
added additional VHDL constructs we believed necessary to make the VHDL
complete and processable by a VHDL '93 compliant analyzer.  As we made
changes to the examples, comments were inserted to demarcate the changes
we made.

The VHDL files are organized into two subdirectories, fail_tests and
pass_tests, corresponding to their being non-compliant or compliant to
the 1076-1993 standard.

If you find errors or corrections to these files, please submit them to
us at vests@cliftonlabs.com.  Thank you.
