VESTs is a test suite for the VHDL language.  It is not intended to be a

the VHDL language.  We welcome and encourage contributions to VESTs with
the restriction that the tests must be distributed under the GNU General
Public License Version 2.  A copy of this license is in this directory
in the file named COPYING.

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

vhdl-93:
    Containing tests against the VHDL 1076-1993 language standard.

vhdl-ams:
    Containing tests against the VHDL 1076.1-1999 language standard.

If you find errors or corrections to files contained herein or would
like to submit additional tests for the VESTs suite, please contact us
